TransSolutions works with firms and industries to develop feasible, cost-effective designs and operational policies in and around transportation facilities. Our consulting services combine an interdisciplinary approach with leading-edge technology to provide our clients with better decision-making information, thus allowing them to improve operational efficiency, forecast expansion requirements, enhance the level of customer service, and reduce costs.

Our clients include: architectural/engineering/planning firms, airport authorities, airlines, corporate campus developers, educational institutions, government entities, healthcare providers, port authorities, retail establishments, stadiums and arenas, transit and rail authorities and transportation planning organizations.

Detailed simulation modeling analyses of proposed facility performance and infrastructure, along with graphical animations provide a visual representation of the system in operation. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) can be added to the modeling tools to allow clients to evaluate scenarios in-house, to determine the impact of changes in procedures or demand.

Our analyses are used to determine whether a proposed design or a set of procedures will achieve desirable levels of customer service.
